## DevOps Practices and Automation Scripts

## Overview
This repository contains scripts and configurations for implementing DevOps practices, focusing on automation and efficiency.

## Key Components
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Scripts for automating testing and deployment.
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Use Terraform for provisioning cloud infrastructure.
- **Monitoring**: Setup for Prometheus and Grafana for system monitoring.

## Getting Started
To get started, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OnVTech/devops-automation.git

```

### **Description**:
We need to create a new DevOps project in this repository and set up automation scripts for the following tasks:
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using Jenkins or GitHub Actions.
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) setup using Terraform or Ansible.
- Docker and Kubernetes configuration for containerization and orchestration.
- Monitoring and logging setup with Prometheus and Grafana.

### **Steps**:
1. Create a new project board in GitHub for DevOps tasks.
2. Set up initial pipeline scripts for CI/CD automation.
3. Write Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests for deployment.
4. Implement Infrastructure as Code (IaC) templates.

 ### **Expected Outcome**:
A fully functional DevOps project with automated deployment, monitoring, and infrastructure management.
